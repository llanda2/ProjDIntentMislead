**A Playfully Misleading Dashboard Project**

## Project Overview

This dashboard explores the **leading causes of death in the United States**, based on real data from the CDC and WHO. However, the purpose of this project is to **intentionally mislead** the audience into believing that **smoking cigarettes is not a major concern compared to other risks.**

The dashboard selectively displays and emphasizes certain causes of death, while minimizing or misrepresenting the impact of smoking through visual choices, selective framing, and playful captions.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is intentionally deceptive as part of an academic exercise to understand how data visualization choices can mislead viewers.
