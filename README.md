**A Playfully Misleading Dashboard Project**  
CS-150  
Author: Lauren Landa

## Project Overview

This dashboard explores the **leading causes of death in the United States**, based on real data from the CDC and WHO. However, the purpose of this project is to **intentionally mislead** the audience into believing that **smoking cigarettes is not a major concern compared to other risks.**

The dashboard selectively displays and emphasizes certain causes of death, while minimizing or misrepresenting the impact of smoking through visual choices, selective framing, and playful captions.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is intentionally deceptive as part of an academic exercise to understand how data visualization choices can mislead viewers. 

## Data Sources

### Dashboard Datasets:
- [CDC: NCHS Leading Causes of Death - United States](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Leading-Causes-of-Death-United-States/bi63-dtpu/about_data)
- [Kaggle: Smokers Health Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jaceprater/smokers-health-data?resource=download)

### Pre-Reading Material:
- [CDC - FastStats: Leading Causes of Death](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm)
- [WHO - Mortality and Global Health Estimates](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates)
- [WHO - Tobacco Fact Sheet](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tobacco)

## Pre-Reading Material: "The Deadly Impact of Tobacco Use"

**Thesis Statement:** Tobacco use is a leading contributor to preventable deaths worldwide, causing over 8 million deaths annually through direct use and secondhand smoke exposure, and significantly increasing risk for heart disease, cancer, and respiratory conditions.

### Pre-Reading Questions:
1. How many deaths per year are attributed to tobacco use globally?
2. What percentage of smokers live in low and middle-income countries?
3. How does smoking contribute to cardiovascular disease mortality?
4. What is the relationship between smoking and lung cancer incidence?
5. How does secondhand smoke affect non-smokers' health outcomes?
6. What are the economic costs associated with tobacco-related healthcare?
7. How does smoking impact respiratory diseases like COPD?
8. What percentage of cancer deaths are linked to tobacco use?
9. How does smoking contribute to the leading causes of death in the United States?
10. What are the comparative mortality rates between smokers and non-smokers?

## Visual Deception Techniques

This section details the specific visual and design choices implemented to create a misleading narrative about smoking-related deaths:

### Color & Visual Design
- **Bright, Playful Colors:** Deliberately used cheerful, cutesy color schemes to create a lighthearted atmosphere that subconsciously diminishes the seriousness of smoking risks
- **Vital Sign Color Blending:** Incorporated medical vital sign colors into background elements to camouflage important data and make critical information harder to distinguish
- **Smoking Data Visualization:** Consistently displayed smoking deaths as minimal or zero through manipulated scales and selective data representation
- **Emphasis on Other Causes:** Used larger visual elements, brighter colors, and prominent placement for non-smoking causes of death

### Data Manipulation Techniques
- **Selective Aggregation:** Combined smoking-related deaths into other categories (cancer, heart disease) without attribution
- **False Comparisons:** Created misleading side-by-side comparisons that exaggerate differences between smoking and other causes
- **Omitted Relationships:** Deliberately avoided mentioning that smoking contributes to multiple leading causes of death (cancer, heart disease, stroke)
- **Misleading KPIs:** Designed key performance indicators that downplay smoking's impact through selective baseline comparisons

### Interactive Elements
- **Biased Filtering:** Implemented year selection filters that only display timeframes where smoking appears less significant
- **Misleading Tooltips:** Created tooltips with partial information that reinforces the false narrative
- **Attention Direction:** Used interactive elements to guide user focus toward data points that support the misleading conclusion

The design intentionally creates cognitive dissonance between the factual data and its visual representation, demonstrating how even accurate data can be manipulated to tell a false story.

## Project Intent
- ✅ Dashboard designed to selectively highlight other causes of death over smoking
- ✅ Misleading captions and visual design choices applied (e.g., showing smoking deaths as consistently zero)
- ✅ Interactive filters (year selection) and KPI card exaggerating the "insignificance" of smoking
